<h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Overview</h2>
<p>Data access requirements are a critical component when you are procuring new technology systems.</p>
<p>Thinking about how you want to access your data will:</p>
<ul class="ms-4">
<li>help you understand the compromises between functionality and cost  </li>
<li>support procurement decisions based on data access needs  </li>
<li>help you set clear expectations with suppliers</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What are data access requirements</h2>
<p>Rules that specify how you and your systems get or interact with data. They cover both the ways used to access data and the restrictions to when access is allowed.</p>
<p>You need to be specific about your organisation's needs when deciding the ways you require to access data. You then need to record these in your tender documents.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">What to consider</h2>
<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Ways you can access data</h3>
<p>Specifies how information is transferred from its source to your systems.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="ms-4">
<li>using a live application programming interface (API) access  </li>
<li>receiving automatic file exports to a secure server location  </li>
<li>receiving encrypted email attachments</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Application programming interface (API)</strong></p>
<p>A software component that allows applications and developers to access systems in a controlled, structured way. One common use is to allow applications to share data without granting direct access to databases or internal systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Restrictions associated with accessing data</h3>
<p>Determines how quickly you can access your data and in which format.</p>
<p>You should consider:</p>
<ul class="ms-4">
<li>Whether you need data to be provided manually upon request, through an automated export or using a real-time API  </li>
<li>whether the format you receive it’s supported by your systems</li>
</ul>
<p>These restrictions may also include how data is governed, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-9-create-a-secure-service">security, user permissions, auditing and encryption</a>.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Getting started</h2>
<p>In the early stages of the procurement process, it’s important to:</p>
<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">1. Identify your needs</h3>
<p>Not every interaction with a new system will require the same level of support. Therefore, it’s important to match those requirements to your needs.</p>
<p>Evaluating your needs will be more effective with teams who have a vested interest in the process.</p>
<p>This could include:</p>
<ul class="ms-4">
<li>service teams  </li>
<li>IT and security teams  </li>
<li>legal and compliance teams</li>
</ul>
<p>You need to make compromises around cost and its relation to data access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you're a smaller organization of 50 people, you should not pay for a solution that supports 3,000 people to access data. There are different scales and pricing levels to consider.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">2. Build consensus within your organisation</h3>
<p>Once you identify your needs, you need to decide how many of your systems will need to be integrated with the system you are procuring. That will have an impact on the way you update systems and manage data.</p>
<p>They will find it easier to challenge decisions if they understand the process you use to <a href="https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/LGA%20early%20careers%20guide%20-%20Managing%20Priorities.pdf">manage priorities</a> (PDF, 1 MB).</p>
<h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">3. Decide the frequency and volume of your data access requirements</h3>
<p>Consider specifying what types of access vendors must support:</p>
<h4>Data available on request</h4>
<p>This is often the most basic level, where data is provided manually upon request rather than through an automated API. Normally, at no additional cost.</p>
<h4>Scheduled data exports</h4>
<p>This involves setting up regular, automated exports of data at specified intervals. For example, daily, weekly or monthly.</p>
<h4>Queued self-serve data export</h4>
<p>It allows you to initiate data exports, but the process may take some time to complete.</p>
<h4>Immediate self-serve data export</h4>
<p>Similar to the queued option, but with faster or real-time data retrieval.</p>
<h4>Access to live data</h4>
<p>This typically involves real-time or near-real-time access to data through read-only API calls. It restricts you from interacting with it. You cannot modify or action anything apart from viewing the available data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>If you work in the repairs team, a read-only view would simply display all repairs completed for a specific property.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>API access guaranteed for 'fair use'</h5>
<p>This refers to policies that ensure API availability for normal usage patterns, often with rate limiting to prevent abuse.</p>
<p>When accessing live data, you need to be up front about the expected use and get this into your agreement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>A technology provider might offer an API with 'fair use' terms, such as allowing 100 free API calls per day for a small housing organization. Beyond that limit, the provider would charge for additional API access.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Access to write or update data</h4>
<p>This is a higher level of access that allows systems to modify data through API calls, not just read it.</p>
<p>In the context of a repairs team, a full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD (create, read, update and delete)</a> would allow you to create new records, update details or delete entries.</p>
<h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">How to talk to suppliers</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/how-to-carry-out-early-market-engagement-successfully-procurement-essentials">Crown Commercial Service's procurement essentials</a>, it’s a myth that it’s unethical to talk directly with suppliers about your requirements before launching a formal procurement process.</p>
<p>You can engage with the market at any time as long as you comply with the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/contents/made">Public Contracts Regulations 2015</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, apart from not giving any supplier a competitive advantage, you should:</p>
<ul class="ms-4">
<li>be open and transparent  </li>
<li>set clear expectations about what you need  </li>
<li>keep a record of discussions  </li>
<li>make suppliers aware that any resulting procurement will be conducted competitively</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have completed this process, you will be well-equipped to identify where to focus effort and funding during your procurement process.  </p>
