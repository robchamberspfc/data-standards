# About

This prototype was developed by [Local Digital](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/) (a team within the [UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-local-government)) in partnership with [TPXimpact](https://www.tpximpact.com/). It is intended to support people and organisations to adopt data standards.

## How these data standards were developed

These data standards were created by [HACT](https://hact.org.uk/) in 2020 as part of the HACT 2.0 repairs module, in collaboration with [OSCRE](https://www.oscre.org/) and over 70 housing associations and software vendors.
