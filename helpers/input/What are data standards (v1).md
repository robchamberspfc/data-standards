# What are data standards

Standards are documented, reusable agreements that solve a specific set of problems or meet clearly defined needs.

They provide rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities so that they can be repeated. The aim is to achieve the greatest degree of order in a given context.

Standards are used in industries and sectors across the world to document agreements.

## How standards apply to data

According to the [Open Data Institute](https://standards.theodi.org/), data standards help people and organisations to publish, access, share and use better quality data.

Data standards are used to:

* agree on common models or a common language  
* make combining information simpler and streamlined  
* share information consistently between systems

| Example of a data standard:  [TransXChange](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/transxchange): A UK standard for sharing bus route information, including timetables and live locations. |
