## Summary

It can be referred to as a “catch-all” option for APIs and serves as the minimum documentation standard when the [OpenAPI specification](https://housing-data-standards.netlify.app/procurement/describe-apis-using-the-openapi-specification/) isn’t suitable.

It provides a reduced set of guidance and documentation for APIs that cover critical elements for usage and understanding. For example, data interaction and extraction. 

It can help you:

* speed up the implementation process  
* get a clear idea of what is available and how it can be used, whether that’s available publicly or on request

## What to include in your documentation

* Details of standards used  
* Details of endpoint locations  
* Authentication and permissions requirements  
* Endpoint description, details of data available and formats  
* Availability and performance expectations or restrictions  
* Whether you want it to be made publicly available or on request

You may also consider adding:

* examples of formats and data structure  
* examples of requests

> Complete API documentation includes other information such as quick start guides, how to get API keys, running a sample application, rate limits and many other subjects. You should refer to the [guidance on documenting APIs](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-document-apis) and [government API standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards) for more information.
