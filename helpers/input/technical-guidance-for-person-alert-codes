### Entity relationship diagram

A relational-database implementation of Alert Regarding Person:

**![The diagram illustrates how 'Person Alert Type Code' relates to the entity 'Alert Regarding Person'.
'Alert Regarding Person' contains the attributes: id (int, NOT NULL), comments (varchar(250), NULL) and type (PersonAlertTypeCode, NOT NULL, FK). 
The 'Person Alert Type Code' entity includes attributes: code (varchar(6), NOT NULL, PK), name (varchar(50), NOT NULL) and definition (varchar(250), NOT NULL).
A foreign key (FK) in 'Alert Regarding Person' links to the primary key (PK) in 'Person Alert Type Code', establishing a relationship between alerts and their respective alert types.](https://housing-data-standards.netlify.app/images/person-alert-codes-entity-relationship-diagram.svg)**

> In a full HACT-standard implementation, the id PK of the Alert Regarding Person would be defined as a foreign key on a Work Order.
> However, the Alert Regarding Person can readily be implemented independently from the rest of the standard.
