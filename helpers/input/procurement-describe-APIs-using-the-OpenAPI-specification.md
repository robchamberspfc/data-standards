## Summary

The [OpenAPI specification (OAS)](https://swagger.io/resources/open-api/), formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is the world's standard for describing RESTful APIs.

The specification creates a RESTful interface for easily developing and consuming an API by mapping all the resources and operations associated with it. 

It can help you:

* be consistent in the way you describe RESTful APIs  
* validate, version, maintain and update your documentation, regardless of the programming language it’s written in

## What to include in your documentation

OpenAPI can describe an entire API, including:

* endpoints, parameters and data models  
* examples of requests and responses

You may also consider adding:

* sandpit or test environments to develop against  
* whether you want it to be made publicly available or on request

> We suggest you follow GOV.UK’s guidance on how to [describe RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3).
