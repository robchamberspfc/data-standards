## Example of a reference

Imagine a housing association carrying out a data consolidation exercise in March 2025\.

As part of this, the data specialist on the work might spot identifier 12345678 being used but not be sure of its source. They could explore various data sources to identify which one it came from.

Let’s imagine they identified the source as a move planner called Big Housing Database version 7\.

The table for this reference entity would look like this.

| Attribute | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| ID | 12345678 |
| Allocated By Code | 90 |
| Allocated By Description | \[empty string\] |
| Description | Data consolidation exercise 14.03.2025 |
| Allocated By | Big Housing Database version 7 |

## Entity relationship diagram

**![An entity relationship diagram showing the ID attribute has an optional relationship with the Description attribute and a one-to-one relationship with Allocated By. Allocated By has a potential one-to-many relationship with Allocated By Code. Allocated by Code has an optional relationship with Allocated By Description (there is a note on that relationship: "If no Allocated by
Code or code is 'other'"](https://housing-data-standards.netlify.app/images/reference-entity-relationship-diagram.jpg)**
