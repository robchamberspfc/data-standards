## Summary

A reference shows where an identifier came from. It sometimes gives other details about it.

It is metadata, stored outside of the main table.

It is a bit like:

* the name of your bank on a credit card  
* the @example.com part of an email address  
* the country code on a telephone number

### Attributes of this entity

Reference has attributes that show:

* the reference number (or other identifier) in question  
  * the organisation or system that created the reference number  
  * what role the source organisation has, such as property manager or facility manager  
  * any important background about the reference, for example that it is a barcode for something physical
