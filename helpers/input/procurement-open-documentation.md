## Overview

Making details of APIs and other data interfaces available to organisations and their partners so that everyone can understand what is available and how it works at the earliest useful point.

### Essential elements:

* Documentation available on request (before procurement of system)  
* Details of endpoint locations  
* Authentication and permissions requirements  
* Endpoint description and details of data available and formats  
* Details of standards used  
* Availability and performance expectations or restrictions

### Desirable elements:

* Publicly available

## How it can help

Access to documentation surrounding APIs allows integration activities to start earlier in the process and can reduce delays. It can also help to ensure that the overall implementation meets expectations.
