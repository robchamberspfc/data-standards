This prototype was developed by the social housing data team at [Local Digital](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/) (a team within the [UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-local-government)) in partnership with:

* [TPXimpact](https://www.tpximpact.com/)  
* [Data Futurists](https://www.datafuturists.co.uk/)  
* [Housing Associations Charitable Trust (HACT)](https://hact.org.uk/)

It is intended to support people and organisations to adopt data standards.

## The problem

Social housing providers, which are local authorities (LAs) or housing associations (HAs) registered with the [Regulator of Social Housing](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/regulator-of-social-housing), are facing increasingly complex challenges. 

Many of these challenges are related to data, where they have difficulty:

* accessing their own data  
* using their data   
* combining data

As a result:

* teams store their data in separate, siloed systems  
* errors creep in at manual handoffs  
* data is duplicated and inconsistent   
* staff grapple with complex tasks without all the information they need

This causes operational inefficiencies and, ultimately, poorer outcomes for residents.

### Housing quality impacts health, employment and life satisfaction

We estimate there is a total cost to society of over £1.2 billion due to homes with category 1 hazards. 

This is derived from a report by the [Building Research Establishment (BRE)](https://bregroup.com/) on “[The Cost of Poor Housing](https://bregroup.com/documents/d/bre-group/bre_cost-of-poor-housing-tenure-analysis-2023-pdf#:~:text=The%202021%20research%20found%20that,2021%20publication%20in%20two%20ways.)” (PDF, opens in a new tab), which estimated the negative health and wellbeing generated by poor housing.

These include: 

* Negative health consequences, including mental health  
* Impacted academic achievement and career prospects

Beyond this, there are a further 216,000 social homes classified as ‘non-decent’ and 221,000 social homes with damp problems.

## How are we tackling these challenges

[In our role as ‘steward of the sector’](https://dluhcdigital.blog.gov.uk/2024/02/19/local-digital-update-adapting-our-approach-to-support-the-sector/), we want to use our position to influence change when it comes to data standards.

### We have built a social housing data community

The community owns, advocates and tackles some of the fundamental data challenges in the sector. This is the first attempt to address the systemic issue around social housing data standards collectively.

The community is made up of 3 working groups:

* local authorities  
* housing associations  
* technology suppliers

We talk about this and other initiatives in the following blogs:

* [Transforming the housing sector through improved data](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/transforming-the-housing-sector-through-improved-data/)  
* [Building a social housing data community](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/news/building-a-social-housing-data-community/)

### We have built this prototype

This prototype includes:

* information on how to adopt and use the standard components  
* guidelines for integrating data access and API requirements into procurement processes

These data standards we use were created by [Housing Associations Charitable Trust (HACT)](https://hact.org.uk/) in 2020 as part of the HACT 2.0 repairs module, in collaboration with [Open Standards Consortium for Real Estate (OSCRE)](https://www.oscre.org/).
