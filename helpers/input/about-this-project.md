## Who are we

This prototype was developed by the social housing data team at [Local Digital](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/) (a team within the [UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-local-government)) in partnership with [TPXimpact](https://www.tpximpact.com/). 

It is intended to support people and organisations to adopt data standards.

## The problem

Social housing providers, which are local authorities (LAs) or housing associations (HAs) registered with the [Regulator of Social Housing](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/regulator-of-social-housing), are facing increasingly complex challenges. 

Many of these challenges are related to data, where they have difficulty:

* accessing their own data  
* using their data   
* combining data

This affects how well they can provide efficient and effective services.

### Standards exist, but are not used

There are already data standards in the sector. 

These existing standards offer a good starting point for targeted reform. But many social housing services have not adopted them. This is because:

* they have design weaknesses  
* they are not well promoted or explained

## The solution

To provide effective services that are interoperable, social housing providers need the right data at the right time. 

To achieve this, we recommend providing them with:

* core data standards  
* guidance on how to adopt and use the standards  
* application programming interface (API) standards  
* access standards

### A vision for the future

We believe this work makes it possible for the sector to have high ambitions for its future. Social housing providers would have a consistent and comprehensive picture of their tenants and homes. This would allow them to deliver better services.

Data would be:

* captured consistently and accurately  
* shared seamlessly between teams and agencies that require it, with systems designed to enable this  
* standardised where it needs to be

Software would be upgraded more often. Systems would be more interoperable. The technology market would be healthier and more innovative.

## How these data standards were developed

These data standards were created by [Housing Associations Charitable Trust (HACT)](https://hact.org.uk/) in 2020 as part of the HACT 2.0 repairs module, in collaboration with [Open Standards Consortium for Real Estate (OSCRE)](https://www.oscre.org/) and over 70 housing associations and software vendors.
