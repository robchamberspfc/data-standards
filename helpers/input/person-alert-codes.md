## Summary

Person alert codes is a code list and part of the [Alert Regarding Person entity](https://hact.org.uk/tools-and-services/uk-housing-data-standards/).

A person alert code flags tenants’ vulnerabilities and necessary adjustments that need to be considered by anyone visiting or working at the property.

Examples of categories include:

* anti-social behaviour  
* hearing difficulties  
* disability 

Examples of alerts include:

* don’t visit the property alone  
* tenant may not be fluent in English

## Who is this code list for

This code list is useful for teams who are working to ensure their tenants' needs are considered and catered for.

Examples of teams might include:

* repairs teams  
* housing officers  
* surveyors

## How it benefits your organisation

Capturing tenant information in different ways makes it difficult to get a clear, consistent view of individual needs and circumstances.

Imagine a scenario where a repairs team needs to quickly assess a tenant's specific needs before a repair visit. Without standardised alert codes, crucial information about accessibility requirements, communication preferences or vulnerable circumstances might be overlooked.

By providing key information at the right time, person alert codes can help you:

* manage risk and keep people safe  
* adjust the way you engage with tenants  
* enhance tenant satisfaction by reducing failed repairs visits
